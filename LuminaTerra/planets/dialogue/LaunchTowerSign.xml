      <Page>Hey, Hatchling! I made a weird discovery the other day that I thought you might be interested in.</Page>
      <Page>When I was tuning my deep space radio, I picked up a strange signal from a nearby star system. It's unlike anything I've ever heard before from space!</Page>
      <Page>Since your ship is equipped with that new "warp drive" technology now, I thought you might want to go check it out. I'm certainly curious about what's there.</Page>
      <Page>Whether you decide to go or not, I've sent the coordinates of the star system to your ship computer.</Page>
      <Page>Safe travels!</Page>
